## Currently working on:

I am currently earning the Udacity Programming Nano-degree as an Accenture Scholarship Program recipient. I am also working through some Docker and Kubernetes tutorials, oh and I am playing around with setting up XCP-ng on some old computers (hardware is too old for practical use) to get more experience administering VMs. I also keep threatening to re-learn Latin.
